<p>Building quality tires is not for amateurs. The end  product may seem simple, but the process of developing that product is anything  but! Building quality tires is a complex process that calls for sophisticated  machinery. Formulating and then mixing the rubber compound is just the  beginning. There&rsquo;s also the preparation of the cord, the calendering steps for  belt, ply, and the innermost layer of the tire. Next come the bead component  preparation and the extrusion of tread and sidewall.<p>&nbsp;</p>
  Only then can the tire building truly proceed. This is in  itself is an involved process. The wrapping of inner liner and ply is followed,  one stage at a time, by the application of the bead assemblies, sidewall,  belts, cap, and tread. As you move through each of these steps, the quality of  the machinery really starts to tell. By the time you get to the curing process,  it&rsquo;s obvious&mdash;a quality tire depends on a quality tire building machine. <p>&nbsp;</p>
  At Soberay and Sons, we&rsquo;re known for the high quality  used tire machinery that we sell. We search the globe to bring you the highest  quality of secondhand tire machinery available.

<p>Combining diverse materials to produce  a smooth compound can be a challenging process. Consider, for example, how  widely degrees of hardness can vary in different materials.&nbsp; On some mixers, the rotor blade that works  effectively for one kind of material may not work as well for another kind of  material. Yet uniformity of texture and distribution is critical to the  successful mixing of a rubber compound. So how do you allow for divergent  materials and still achieve a smooth result?<p>&nbsp;</p>
  Soberay and Sons has the answer. Our  new unused F270 Banbury rubber mixer is designed to meet the challenge of  cutting, combining, and mixing materials of low to high hardness. This Farrel  rubber mixer represents a major improvement over older rubber mixing machinery.  The F270 Banbury mixer has an  enhanced chamber, or mixer hopper, that holds up to 246 liters. The steep  angle of hopper door also makes it easier to add rubber and other materials  into the mixer. <p>&nbsp;</p>
  In addition, the four-wing rotor system  makes for a smoother mix, as each wing has its own specific function. Now it&rsquo;s  easier to introduce polymers into the mix without damaging their  attributes.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s also easier to disperse  the various materials evenly throughout the mix. With the Farrel brand F270 Banbury rubber mixer,  every step of the mixing process is quality controlled. <p>&nbsp;</p>
  Click on the item number below to see several different  perspectives of the Farrel rubber mixer. As you will see, this product is in  pristine condition. This is an excellent opportunity to obtain unused rubber  production equipment at a discount.&nbsp; The  F270 Banbury mixer offers several benefits: </p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It achieves advanced mixing of a wide array of materials. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It delivers excellent bond ratios and uniform polymer  bonding.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s easy to clean and maintain. <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It offers new machinery quality at a used-machinery  price. <br>
